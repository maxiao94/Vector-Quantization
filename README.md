K-Means &amp; K-Medians Clustering using Euclidean Distance &amp; Manhattan Distance

[K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) and [K-Medians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medians_clustering) have many applications (under the correct assumptions). 

In the code, a dictionary of centroid information is updated iteratively such that the loop stops when the centroids from the previous iteration remain unchanged in the current iteration. The points belonging to the determined respective clusters are color-coordinated to tell them apart. 

The image files correspond to the 3 examples at the bottom of the script. For each example, the initial data points are black and the initial centroid guess are each uniquely colored; the determined clusters are color-coordinated in the final version.
